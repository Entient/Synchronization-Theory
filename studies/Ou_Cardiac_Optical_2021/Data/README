# Cardiac E-C Coupling Analysis*

## Dataset Description
- **Source:** Dual optical mapping (voltage/calcium) from mouse hearts
- **Groups:** Sham (n=57) and TAC (n=51) recordings
- **Frequencies:** 2, 4, 8, 16 Hz pacing
- **Acquisition:** 250 Hz per channel, simultaneous dual-camera

## Analysis Pipeline

### 1. Timeseries Extraction
- Channel 0 = Calcium (sharp transients)
- Channel 1 = Voltage (plateau morphology)
- ROI-averaged signals exported as NPY files

### 2. Tier 1 Analysis
- Phase-locking value (PLV) via Hilbert transform
- E-C lag via cross-correlation (constrained ±T/2)
- Beat-by-beat variability (CV)
- Coupling gain (ΔCa/ΔV slope)
- Kinetics (TTP, tau, APD, upstroke)

### 3. Tier 2 Analysis
- Band-limited PLV (2/4/8/16 Hz bands)
- Hysteresis orientation (CCW vs CW)
- Alternans detection (AI > 0.10)

## Key Findings
- PLV preserved across Sham/TAC (p=0.69)
- Frequency effect on PLV (p=0.013)
- Normal temporal sequence (Vm→Ca, >85% CCW)
- U-shaped alternans pattern (8Hz stability window)
- No disease effect on any E-C coupling metric

*Channel identity verification:
Channel assignment was verified by signal morphology (Supplementary Figure S1). 
Calcium transients exhibit sharp upstrokes with rapid decay (blue trace), while voltage signals show characteristic action potential plateaus (orange trace). 
Initial channel labels from acquisition software were reversed and corrected prior to analysis."
