🧬 The Geometry of Life

A Unified Theory of Biological Information Processing, Aging, Consciousness, and Evolution

The Geometry of Life proposes that all living systems—molecules, cells, organisms, and minds—operate on the same geometric law of information compression near a fold bifurcation.
From this single topology emerge universal biological constants:

λ = 1/7 – survival threshold

χₑₘₑᵣgₑ = 0.437 – consciousness threshold

χₗᵢfₑ = 0.475 ± 0.016 – optimal life band

C = 6/7* – coherence ceiling

κ = √𝒦 ≈ 1/τₗᵢ𝒻ₑ – constant aging drift rate

Across 547 species spanning 15 orders of magnitude, these constants predict:

A universal information budget of ~3 × 10⁹ cycles per lifetime

Temperature-independent aging (geometric, not thermodynamic)

Consciousness emergence at χ ≈ 0.437

Evolution as resonance tuning, not random selection

This framework unifies biology, aging, consciousness, and evolution under one geometric principle—life as information coherence maintained within fold-bifurcation geometry.
